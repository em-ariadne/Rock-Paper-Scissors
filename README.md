# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Ok so i was trying to find ways online to practice - and i was told to code things. 
So the first thing i made was the Madlibs, and that was fun, i followed the notes i made watching the free code camp video and i feel like i actaully acomplised something 
i used my head to make a program that other people can interact with

and i wanted to do that again 

so after some googling i tried to do a hangman game and decided that was above my skill level 
so i went easier, i made a rock, paper, scissors game

expext i didn't, i copied some code i found on the internet 
it was competely un satsifying, i didn't make this 

i figured i would be able to follow some basic instructions, and i did, but it was so simpler there was nothing to think about 
all i learned was about the random function ( import.random) 

back to the drawing board, maybe sit down and try and think of my own things to code instead copying code of the internet. 

Second programming attempt - disapointing
